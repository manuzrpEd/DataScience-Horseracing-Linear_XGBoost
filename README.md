# Horseracing exercise

The given sample dataset (‘datatests.csv’) contains information on racing. Table 1 describes the variables that are included in the sample dataset provided. With this dataset, you are asked to employ a statistical regression model to identify the factors that are associated with predicting race winners.

My exercise attempt is [here](https://github.com/manuzrpEd/Horseracing/blob/main/Horseracing.ipynb)
For the exercise, I have:

<li>1.	To provide the relevant descriptive statistics on pertinent variables. The candidate is free to select the most appropriate format to display results (e.g., tabular, graphs, etc.). </li>
<li>2.	Identify whether logistic regression or linear regression is the more appropriate model to predict race winners.</li>
<li>3.	Add relevant variables to the regression model selected.</li>
<li>4.	Display the results of the regression model selected. The candidate is free to select the most appropriate format to display results (e.g., tabular, graphs, etc.).</li>
<li>5.	Provide a very summary of key findings associated with the variables utilised to predict race winners. </li>
